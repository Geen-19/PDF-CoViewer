# PDF Co-Viewer

PDF Co-Viewer is a real-time collaborative platform that allows multiple users to view and interact with a PDF document simultaneously. Users can raise their hands, switch between viewer and admin roles, and follow the adminâ€™s screen as pages change. This project is built with **React** for the frontend and **Node.js** with **Socket.IO** for the backend, enabling seamless real-time updates.
